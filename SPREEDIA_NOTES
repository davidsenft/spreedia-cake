TODO:

- AssetCompress plugin not yet enabled
- Click on Search and load info for City/top via ajax
- Orbit?





These changes were made to the database:

- all ID fields to 'id' and 'xxx_id' except for status and parent
- rename dollarKeys table to prices (and in other tables, price_id)
- merge sales and events into activity
   - rename events to activitys, add 'activityType' w/ value 2
   - add 'activityType' to sales w/ value 1
   - rearrange columns
   - then 'REPLACE INTO activitys SELECT * FROM sales;'
   - change collation of activitys to utf8_unicode_ci
- separate stores into storenames (names/chains) and storeinstances (physical locations)
   - drop the 'chains' table
   - convert to utf8_unicode_ci
   - name stores storenames, and copy it into a new table storeinstances
   - rename storeinstances id to storename_id, then copy that column: UPDATE storeinstances SET id = storename_id
   - storename fields become one word like 'phone' or 'twitter'
   - delete duplicates in storenames, set storename_id of chained stores in storeinstances to be the same
   - get rid of storeCity (add "isCity" field in locations to indicate a the location should be used in addresses)
- rename xref tables and their columns, and add AUTO_INCREMENTing primary keys(?)
- change store_alsolike_xref to a HABTM-through "similarstores" model
- store_images_xref goes to images and images_storeinstances
   - get rid of duplicates in images for stores with only one set of images 
     (artifaktori, black ink, marathon sports, second time around)
   - keep duplicates in images for crush boutique and tannery, but add to images_storeinstances

Stores that have changed:
 - Artifaktori Davis
