TODO:

- storeHours formatting ok? not so in debug.





Database changes:

- all ID fields to 'id' and 'xxx_id' except for status and parent
- rename dollarKeys table to prices (and in other tables, price_id)
- merge sales and events into activity
   - rename events to activitys, add 'activityType' w/ value 2
   - add 'activityType' to sales w/ value 1
   - rearrange sales with 'ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN misplaced_column INT(11) AFTER other_column;'
   - then 'REPLACE INTO activitys SELECT * FROM sales;'
   - change collation of activitys to utf8_unicode_ci
- separate stores into storenames (names/chains) and storeinstances (physical locations)
   - drop the 'chains' table
   - convert to utf8_unicode_ci
   - name stores storenames, and copy it into a new table storeinstances
   - rename storeinstances id to storename_id, then copy that column: UPDATE storeinstances SET id = storename_id
   - storename fields become one word like 'phone' or 'twitter'
   - delete duplicates in storenames, set storename_id of chained stores in storeinstances to be the same
   - get rid of storeCity (add "isCity" field in locations to indicate a the location should be used in addresses)
- rename xref tables and their columns, and add AUTO_INCREMENTing primary keys
- change store_alsolike_xref to "similarstores"
